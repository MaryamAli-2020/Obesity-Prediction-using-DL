# Obesity-Prediction-using-DL
“13% of adults in the world are obese” [6]. The high prevalence of obesity around the world has been a major concern globally! It’s not just a matter of physical health, it affects individuals mentally. In this report I will focus on those people and create a neural network algorithm that performs its best to detect the occurrence of obesity in humans as well as talk about its importance and how we can prevent it from happening with the help of our dataset. In summary, I will answer as many of these questions as possible: Can your physical conditions lead to obesity? The effect of the number and type of meals on obesity? Is Obesity something inherited? Is it important to know the number of calories contained in the meals you eat and the amount of food? Will the model we create detect if you have obesity, or not? Will using the concept of Neural Networking increase the accuracy and precision of the prediction compared to machine learning?
